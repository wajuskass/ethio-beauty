        <p>To classify Ethiopia's national costume into one easily identifiable variety is a daunting task. There are of course the well known snow white outfits that have been commonly associated with Ethiopia's national identity but this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>Each tribe or ethnic group that resides within Ethiopia's borders has its own styles and varieties. Ethiopia is a large country with a wide range of climates and landscapes. This, in itself, is a cause for the differences in attire among the diverse peoples of the country.</p>
